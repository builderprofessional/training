        <p>Canceling your plan is a big step. It means that you will no longer have access to all the great features that
          Builder Professional offers.</p>

        <p>We don't take your decision to cancel lightly, and we hope you'll give us another chance to keep your business.
          You can call us at 800-659-6410 to discuss your issues and get help. If you would like to change your mind and give
          us a chance to make things right for you, please click the "Never Mind" button below
          and call or email us at <a href="mailto:support@builders-software.com">support@builders-software.com</a>.

        <p>If you are certain you want to cancel your service completely, click the button labeled "Yes, Cancel My Account."
          Your credit card will not be charged again, but your account will remain active until your next billing date on
          {{BillingClientProduct.model.NextBillDate | engDate : 'MM/dd/yyyy' }}. At that time you will no longer have access to the service.</p>

        <p>If you change your mind at any time, you can always log back in here and reactivate your desired plan. We will have all your existing
          estimates and templates on file for you.</p>
